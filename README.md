# HelpyFun by Chicago Booth Analytics Club

This repo is developed and maintained by members of the Analytics Club at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.

The repo contains miscellaneous "helper" Python functions (hence the name "**HelpyFun**") and custom data structures that are useful for a wide variety of Python programming tasks.

This is also a fun medium for our Analytics Club members to learn and practice the following:

* General Python programming;
* Version control via Git and GitHub;
* Packaging and distributing a Python package; and
* Co-programming and co-governing a shared software development project in general.
