# Tutorials on Data Frames and Relational Databases
 
This repository contains tutorials on manipulating data frames and querying relational databases. Tools covered include:

- Traditional `SQL` tools such as __`PostgreSQL`__ and __`MySQL`__;

- `R` __`data.frame`__ and __`data.table`__;

- `Python` __`Pandas`__ data frames; and
 
- `Apache Spark`, which ships with __`Spark DataFrame`__ and __`Spark SQL`__.

In order to provide meaningful context and motivation, tutorials are structured as dataset-centric cases, with similar examples illustrated in multiple ways by different tools.
